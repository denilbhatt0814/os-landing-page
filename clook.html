                LOOK/ C-LOOK ALGORITHM
            </div>

            <p>Look and C-look are two disk scheduling algorithms used by operating systems to determine the order in
                which disk requests are processed. The disk scheduling algorithm plays an important role in determining
                the overall performance of the system, as it determines the efficiency with which the system accesses
                and retrieves data from the disk.</p>

            <p>The Look algorithm, also known as the elevator algorithm, is a disk scheduling algorithm that works by
                moving the disk arm in one direction only, either towards the outermost track or towards the innermost
                track of the disk. When a disk request is made, the Look algorithm determines the direction in which the
                disk arm is currently moving, and then schedules the request to be processed in the same direction. Once
                all the requests in that direction have been processed, the algorithm changes direction and starts
                processing the requests in the other direction.</p>

            <p>The C-look algorithm is an improvement over the Look algorithm, as it tries to reduce the average access
                time by avoiding unnecessary disk arm movement. The C-look algorithm works by moving the disk arm
                towards the last request in the queue in the current direction, and then reversing direction once it
                reaches the last request. This means that the disk arm only moves back and forth between the requests
                that are currently in the queue, without having to move all the way to the outermost or innermost track
                of the disk.</p>

            <p>However, the Look and C-look algorithms may not be suitable for all scenarios. For example, if there are
                a large number of requests for data on a particular track of the disk, the Look and C-look algorithms
                may spend a lot of time moving the disk arm back and forth between that track and the other tracks. In
                such cases, other disk scheduling algorithms, such as the Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) or the SCAN
                algorithm, may be more suitable.</p>

            <p class="bigtext">Advantages </p>

            <p>May not be suitable for all scenarios: In some cases, such as when there are a large number of requests
                for data on a particular track of the disk, these algorithms may not be the most efficient choice. Other
                disk scheduling algorithms, such as the Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) or the SCAN algorithm, may be
                more suitable.
                Can cause delay: The Look and C-look algorithms may cause a delay for certain disk requests if they are
                located on the opposite side of the disk arm's current position, as the algorithm may need to move the
                arm to the other side of the disk to process those requests.
                Can result in uneven wear: These algorithms may cause uneven wear on the disk over time, as certain
                areas of the disk may be accessed more frequently than others.

            <p class="bigtext">Disadvantages</p>

            Difficult to accurately estimate processing times, which can lead to longer waiting times for longer
            processes.
            May result in starvation of longer processes, which can impact the overall system performance.
            Preemptive SJF can lead to more overhead due to the frequent switching between processes.
