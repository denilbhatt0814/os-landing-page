                DINING PHILOSOPHER PROBLEM
            </div>

            <p>The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer science, originally
                formulated by Edsger Dijkstra in 1965. The problem involves five philosophers who are sitting at a
                circular table and alternately thinking and eating. There are five chopsticks, one placed between each
                pair of adjacent philosophers.</p>

            <p>The challenge is to design a solution that ensures that each philosopher can pick up the two chopsticks
                adjacent to them and start eating, without causing a deadlock or a starvation situation. A deadlock
                occurs when all the philosophers are waiting for a chopstick that they cannot obtain, and a starvation
                situation occurs when one or more philosophers are always waiting for a chopstick while others eat.</p>

            <p>One solution to the Dining Philosophers problem involves assigning a unique identifier to each chopstick
                and having each philosopher acquire the chopstick with the lower identifier first, then the higher
                identifier. Another solution involves using a monitor or semaphore to enforce mutual exclusion and
                ensure that only one philosopher can pick up a chopstick at a time.</p>

            <p>The Dining Philosophers problem has become a classic example of the challenges of concurrent programming
                and has been used to illustrate a variety of synchronization and deadlock avoidance techniques. It has
                also been applied in other areas, such as resource allocation in distributed systems and scheduling in
                real-time systems.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, the Dining Philosophers problem is an important synchronization problem in computer
                science that illustrates the challenges of concurrent programming. It highlights the need for careful
                design and implementation of synchronization mechanisms to ensure that multiple processes can access
                shared resources without causing deadlocks or starvation</p>

            <p class="bigtext">Advantages</p>

            <p>The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic example that helps computer scientists to understand the
                challenges of synchronization and concurrency in computer systems.
                It provides a practical scenario that enables developers to learn how to apply synchronization
                mechanisms such as semaphores, monitors, and mutexes in real-life situations.
                The Dining Philosophers problem has helped to develop numerous algorithms and techniques to avoid
                deadlocks, prevent race conditions and resolve synchronization problems.
                The problem has applications in other areas, such as resource allocation in distributed systems,
                scheduling in real-time systems, and synchronization in parallel computing.

            <p class="bigtext">Disadvantages</p>

            The Dining Philosophers problem is a contrived example that may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios.
            Some solutions to the Dining Philosophers problem can be complex and difficult to implement.
            The problem assumes a fixed number of resources, in this case, chopsticks, which may not reflect the
            realities of real-world systems that may have variable resources.
            There is no single solution that is universally applicable to the Dining Philosophers problem, and the most
            effective solution may depend on the specific context in which it is applied.
